# Web Scraping Assignment: Analyzing Country Data

This project demonstrates web scraping using Python with BeautifulSoup and Requests. The script extracts and processes country data from the website [Scrape This Site](https://www.scrapethissite.com/pages/simple/).

## Features:
1. **Counting Headings (h1-h5):**
   - Scrapes the webpage and counts the number of `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, and `<h5>` tags.

2. **Finding the Most Populated Country:**
   - Scrapes country names and populations, then identifies the country with the largest population.

3. **Country Details Starting with 'V':**
   - Filters countries starting with the letter "V" and prints their capital and population details.

## Technologies Used:
- **Python**: The core programming language used for writing the script.
- **BeautifulSoup**: Used to parse HTML and extract data from the webpage.
- **Requests**: Sends HTTP requests to retrieve the webpage's content.
